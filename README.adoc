= Automatic version upgrades

This is an example project which supports my https://example.com[blog post
about automatic version upgrades].

This repository contains two options how automatic version updates might be
done.

Directory `refreshVersions-plugin` contains a solution using
https://jmfayard.github.io/refreshVersions/[RefreshVersions].

Directory `gradle-version-catalog` contains a solution using 
https://docs.gradle.org/8.0.2/userguide/platforms.html#sub:central-declaration-of-dependencies[Gradle version catalogs].

Both solutions do not contain any actual code. The only purpose is to show 
different ways to manage automatic version upgrades with gradle.
